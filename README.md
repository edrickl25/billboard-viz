# Listening through Y2K Trends
Examining Virality and Longevity of the Songs from our Childhood 


by Edrick Leong

--------------------------


My project aims to visualize music trends of the 2000s, in terms of longevity and virality across many music genres. Debut positions and weeks on the chart are examined and compared, to show specific patterns of what was popular. When looking at the data by genre, there are also popularity trends that can be interpreted from the data.

# Listening through Y2K Trends
Examining Virality and Longevity of the Songs from our Childhood 


by Edrick Leong

--------------------------


My project aims to visualize music trends of the 2000s, in terms of longevity and virality across many music genres. Debut positions and weeks on the chart are examined and compared, to show specific patterns of what was popular. When looking at the data by genre, there are also popularity trends that can be interpreted from the data.

The inspiration for this project came from my long-time interest in Billboard Hot 100 charts and music data in general. In 2021, I did a project just like this, but for the 2010s and on Tableau, so I was determined to create a version of it for the 2000s and on d3/js.

A lot of my knowledge of the charts came from reading many articles detailing Billboard's history and SoundScan tracking. I also wanted to recreate a 2000s feel for the site, so I got inspiration from many website templates for MySpace and even the website from iCarly, which was perfect for inspiring the round border radius on all my paragraphs. The colors were very Nickelodeon-inspired, as that's what I associate with the 2000s, and the Juicebox Interactive blog was helpful with the hex codes to perfectly capture that nostalgic essence. I was and still am a complete amateur when it comes to programming, so I owe a ton to my professor Rachel Daniell, who guided me through the project stages and all kinds of other d3 fundamentals that I needed to learn to get here.

      <h3>Comparing Debut Positions and Longevity of the Songs from our Childhood</h3>
      <h4>Goal: Iâ€™m visualizing the Billboard Hot 100 data of the 2000s, while looking at the songs that maintained the most longevity and the average debut positions of the songs. I want to show what songs or trends were popular throughout the decade I grew up in, in terms of genre, artist, or style. My goal is to paint a picture of what the decade sounded like musically and if those sounds or trends might have changed over the years.</h4>
